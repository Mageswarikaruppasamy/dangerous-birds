The Harpy Eagle is considered to be the most powerful eagle in the world.It native is the rainforests of South America.
Its thick legs, strong toes, and sharp talons make this species a formidable predator.
It has an impressive wingspan of six and a half feet, and they’re unafraid of hunting down prey as large as sloths and monkeys as a result.
The talons of the harpy eagle can extend up to six inches — longer even than the average claw of a cassowary — and 
their hooked design allows them to grip and hold on to heavy prey while flying to their nests. 
It is also known as "A Flying Killing Machine".</font></p><br><br><br>
